# Reflection 
Creating my personal portfolio was a great learning experience. It allowed me to apply what I’ve learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a real project. I was able to build a website that introduces myself, shows my activities, and provides ways to contact me. It felt rewarding to see how simple code can turn into something useful and presentable. The process helped me understand the importance of organizing code, creating user-friendly designs, and keeping everything responsive for different screen sizes. Overall, this project helped me build more confidence in my web development skills.

# Challenges
One of the main challenges I faced was designing the layout and making it look clean and professional. At first, the colors and spacing didn’t look right, and it was hard to make everything line up properly. I fixed this by using Flexbox and Grid in CSS, which helped improve the layout and alignment. Another challenge was adding interactivity using JavaScript. I wanted to include a dark mode toggle and section switching, and it took some time to make it work smoothly. Also, publishing the portfolio on GitHub Pages was confusing at first, but after learning how to push code to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, I was able to make it live online.

#How to Improve the Next Portfolio
For my next portfolio, I plan to add a contact form using HTML and JavaScript so visitors can message me directly. I also want to include a downloadable resume and use more animations to make the site more interactive. Improving accessibility and optimizing the site for performance will also be a goal. Lastly, I would like to explore using tools like SASS for better styling and possibly frameworks like React in the future.
